# EDA-Project-Loan

## Overview

Hey there! Welcome to my EDA project on loan data. This repository dives into the analysis of a dataset (`loan 2.csv`) to uncover insights about various loan features. From data cleaning to deep dives into relationships using statistical methods and visualizations, we aim to make sense of the numbers behind loans.

## Dataset

I've used `loan 2.csv` for this project. It's packed with information crucial to understanding loan dynamics.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Load and Study the Data

First things first, I loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. It's like unpacking a treasure chest of loan data! Then, I did some initial checks—looking for missing values and getting a feel for the data's basic stats.

### 2. Handle Missing Values

No dataset is perfect. I made sure to identify any missing values and figure out how to deal with them.

### 3. Handle Outliers

Outliers can skew our analysis, so I took the time to spot and handle them in the numerical columns.

### 4. Univariate Analysis

This step is all about getting to know each feature on its own. I crunched numbers to find things like averages, ranges, and more. Plus, I made histograms for the numbers and neat bar plots for the categories.

### 5. Bivariate Analysis

Numbers get even more interesting when we compare them. I used box plots, violin plots, and scatter plots to uncover relationships between different loan features.

### 6. Multivariate Analysis

Here's where things get sophisticated! I dove deep into the correlations between variables with a fancy correlation matrix and heatmaps. And the scatter plot matrix? It's like seeing connections between pairs of variables all at once. Plus, I used PCA to simplify the data without losing the good stuff.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To dive into the analysis, make sure you've got these Python libraries ready:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- scikit-learn

### Results

My analysis is packed with visualizations and stats that give a clear picture of what's happening with loan data. You'll find histograms, bar plots, box plots, violin plots, correlation heatmaps, scatter plot matrices—all aimed at making sense of loans.

### Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by my learning journey at the FutureNSE BootCamp, where I gained insights into loan dynamics. Huge thanks to Ziyaad sir (https://github.com/ziyaad123) for providing the dataset and to the open-source community for their amazing tools and libraries.

### Contributing

I'm open to any contributions that can enhance this analysis! If you've got ideas or improvements, fork the repo, make your magic happen, and send a pull request. Let's make understanding loan data even better!
